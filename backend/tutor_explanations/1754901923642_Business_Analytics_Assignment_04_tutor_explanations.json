    "options": {
      "A": "The color scheme of the company's branding.",

    },
    "explanation": "Okay, let's break down why the correct answer is right and why your initial answer was slightly off.\n\nThe question asks about what color-coding in a dashboard *primarily* indicates. Color-coding systems like green for \"on-track\" and red for \"lagging\" are specifically used to visually represent progress against goals. The core purpose is to quickly communicate whether a metric is performing as expected.\n\nOption C, \"The status of sales performance relative to targets,\" perfectly captures this. Green and red flags directly indicate whether sales are meeting or falling behind their targets.\n\nLet’s look at why your original answer, option B, is incorrect.  Simply stating that it's about the number of employees in the sales department is irrelevant to the purpose of color-coding. Color-coding isn’t about headcount; it's about performance. Option A is also incorrect as branding is a separate design consideration, not the primary function of a dashboard’s color scheme. Option D describes data collection, not the interpretation of the data presented visually.\n\nEssentially, color-coding is a shorthand for quickly assessing performance, and option C is the most accurate reflection of that function."
