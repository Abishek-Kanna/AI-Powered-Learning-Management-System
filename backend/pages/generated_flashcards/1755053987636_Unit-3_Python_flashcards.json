    "question": "What is the primary goal of the 'Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters' problem?",
    "answer": "To identify the longest contiguous sequence of characters within a string, where no two adjacent characters are the same."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe the general approach to solving the 'Repeated Substring Pattern' problem.",
    "answer": "The solution checks if the string can be constructed by repeatedly concatenating a substring. It often involves recognizing a potential substring and verifying if the original string can be created by repeating that substring."
  },
  {
    "question": "How would you efficiently find all anagrams of a pattern string within a larger string?",
    "answer": "Count the frequency of each character in the pattern string. Then, iterate through the larger string, counting the frequency of characters in each window of the same length as the pattern. If the character frequencies match, we've found an anagram."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the key element in determining if a number is a Palindrome?",
    "answer": "Convert the integer to a string and compare the string with its reversed version."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain the process of adding two binary strings.",
    "answer": "Iterate through the binary strings from right to left, adding the corresponding digits (0 or 1) together. Handle carry-over if the sum is greater than or equal to 2."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can you calculate the number of times a string 'p' appears as a subsequence in a larger string 's'?",
    "answer": "Use a sliding window approach. Iterate through 's' with a window size equal to the length of 'p'. Within each window, compare the characters of the window with the characters of 'p' to see if it is an anagram."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is involved in reversing the vowels of a string?",
    "answer": "Identify and reverse only the vowels (a, e, i, o, u, case-insensitive) in the string. Reconstruct the string, appending the reversed vowel list."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe the core strategy used in solving the 'Jump Game II' problem.",
    "answer": "A greedy approach: maintain a 'current reach' (the farthest index we can reach from our current position) and update it based on jump lengths."
  },
  {
    "question": "Outline the steps for converting a Roman numeral string to its integer equivalent.",
    "answer": "Iterate through the Roman numeral string. Utilize a map to associate Roman numeral characters with their corresponding integer values. Sum up the values of the recognized Roman numerals."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the central concept behind the 'Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters' problem?",
    "answer": "The problem focuses on identifying the longest contiguous sequence of characters within a string, where no two adjacent characters are the same. It's a classic string manipulation challenge."
