  },
  {
    "question": "What is the E-Rater automated essay scoring system?",
    "answer": "E-Rater is a widely used automated essay scoring system that mimics human graders by employing complex algorithms to quantify various facets of writing quality, often utilizing a many-faceted Rasch model."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve?",
    "answer": "An ROC curve is a graphical representation used to evaluate binary classification models, assessing their ability to discriminate between classes by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Cohen’s Kappa statistic and why is it important?",
    "answer": "Cohen’s Kappa is a measure of inter-rater reliability, quantifying the degree of agreement between different raters, accounting for chance agreement. It’s crucial when multiple raters assess the same data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What challenges do imbalanced datasets pose in NLP evaluation?",
    "answer": "Imbalanced datasets, where one class (e.g., ‘good’ writing) is vastly overrepresented, can mislead traditional evaluation metrics like ROC curves, necessitating specialized techniques to accurately assess model performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is algorithmic efficiency in the context of machine learning models?",
    "answer": "Algorithmic efficiency refers to designing models that achieve high performance while minimizing computational demands, such as memory usage and training time – a key consideration for practical deployment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does it mean for a machine learning model to be ‘efficient’?",
    "answer": "Model efficiency means achieving high performance in terms of accuracy or other metrics while minimizing computational resources like memory and processing time, essential for practical implementation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is inter-rater reliability (measured by Kappa) important in automated essay scoring?",
    "answer": "Inter-rater reliability, quantified by Kappa, is vital in automated essay scoring to ensure consistency and minimize bias in the evaluation process by measuring the degree of agreement between different raters."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key components of Scikit-Learn and why is it considered a foundational resource?",
    "answer": "Scikit-Learn provides a comprehensive set of tools and algorithms for data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation, making it a foundational resource for anyone entering the field of machine learning."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the ROC curve help evaluate models with imbalanced data?",
    "answer": "The ROC curve allows for a more robust evaluation of models with imbalanced data by assessing the true positive and false positive rates, providing a comprehensive view beyond simple accuracy metrics."
